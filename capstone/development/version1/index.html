        <p>
          Hi! Harper is a harp seal pup in desperate need of your help! She is
          only 5 days old but needs to grow up fast to learn how to swim and
          survive the Artic environment. Due to climate change, the sea ice is
          melting fast and she might drown! You can help save Harper by...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Helping her hop across the sea ice to drink milk and grow!</li>
          <li>
            Use the arrow keys to move before timer runs out and the ice cracks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collect all bottles before it is too late! Her fate lies in your
            hands!
          </li>
        </ul>
