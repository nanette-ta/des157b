        <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>

        <article>
            <p>1. What is your topic and who is the target audience?</p>

            <p>I plan to make a geospatial mapping diagram that shows the potential effects of climate change on ecosystems and the animals that thrive in them. At the moment, my target demographic includes people from all age groups.</p>

            <p>2. Identify lenses we have discussed in class that your topic may rely on most</p>

            <p>I want my project to showcase data and trends. I think having a color-coded map for data visualization would be helpful and intuitive for users to see what specific areas are affected by climate change. I am also interested in incorporating a dystopian narrative aspect to the project. I plan to add present and hypothetical future perspectives on the effects of climate change. I think I may also have a character narrator.</p>

            <p>3. What are some of the features you imagine your project/product would include?</p>

            <p>I want to include a color-coded map for easy data visualization and readability. This map would show predictions on the future effects of climate change. It will also have a topographic view. I also want to incorporate graphics of animals who are affected by climate change. Another addition would be a zoom on scroll feature that will allow users to see more information as the project scrolls downward.</p>

            <p>4. Are there possible tangents, challenges, concerns, or vague ideas related to your ideas?</p>

            <p>A possible challenge is finding accurate data. I will have to find credible resources that include predictions based on research.</p>
